Ambiguity
 - in output format = downstream applications might rely on a specific format.
 LLM's can be used for few shot learning. give some examples and it's labels and ask it to generate label for the new examples
 
 Prompt optimization = chain of thought(ask it to explain itself),take ensemble average of multiple outputs.
 
 Input token length doesn't affect latency that much (in parallel) but output seq length impacts latency.
 
 finetuning benefits
 - can train on more examples
 - more instructions can be baked in thus less tokens during the prompt,less cost.

Generate GPT-3 Embeddings and then use .. recsys + vector databases.

`question1`
Backward and forward compatibility:
- When you get new data, you finetune/retrain. Now does your earlier prompts still work ? you got to think/test all your pipeline.

Compose a task = eg: talk to your data application.

`question2`
testing in case of compositional tasks.

One large commercial application of LLM: `Search and recommendation`

Chartbeat

Why Chartbeat ?

- I'm interested in working in ML-centric companies
- I think that for most of these companies Engineering is the stronger bottleneck than ml.
So to my knowledge, chartbeat works in small teams and offers good combination of ml+engineering problems.

- Headline optimization
