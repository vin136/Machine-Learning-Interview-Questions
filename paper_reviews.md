# Recommender Systems

- why item-item is better than user-user ?
  It also
overcomes challenges with newer and less-frequent users with
sparse history, because the similar items list focuses on the
user’s history as opposed to the history of other users.



- the fact that customers tend to buy a memory card
after buying a camera, rather than the other way
around, might be a good hint that we shouldn’t
recommend the camera when someone buys
the memory card.
- as the cold-start problem, and often requires an
explore/exploit process to give items that have
not yet had much opportunity to be purchased
an opportunity to be shown. Perishable items
such as news or social media posts represent
a particularly challenging form of cold start,
often requiring blending data from contentbased algorithms (using subject, topic, and text)
with behavior-based algorithms (using purchases, views, or ratings)

- for established customers, modeling
time correctly has a large impact on the quality of recommendations.As they age, previous
purchases become less relevant to the customer’s current interests. This is complicated by the
fact that this relevance can attenuate at different rates for different types of items.

- eg: such as a manual on
sailing heavy seas — likely indicate a durable
long-term interest. Others such as a dishwasher
repair kit might not be relevant after this weekend’s project

- Discovering intent: seeking something specific, recommendations should be narrow to help them quickly
find what they need. But when intent is unclear
or uncertain, discovery and serendipity should
be the goal.

Decision Making


Before only record companies

Music markets => have a consumer-producer market(no middleman). A creator should have a transparent data(eg: show where they are being listened,they can go down make a show there) and in this sense AI will create a market. The value of music is also in a personal connection = young kid wears a t-shirt of their favourite artist.

What's the bottleneck ?

Well it's not top-down. Companies can't artificially create it. It's the advertising model that's bad, make the service free and get ads. But what about producer - consumer relationship

## Imagine going to a doctor:

1. prob of heart-attack = 0.7

was it trained on people lk me, recently or 5 yrs ago, is the machine same or not ?

Doctors can all do that but they can do what if experiments ? Poor at uncertainty quantification of this rich kind.

after doctor asking questions => Now you might recall that you've asthma as a child or your parent has heart disease. Now they gauge in counterfactuals, a good doctor might have dialogue (medical reasoning). Real world decision making is always of this kind.


And in life we are making lot of interlaced decisions. and your decisions are affecting other peoples decisions (economics)

Recommending books => easy (no supply demand issues, can recommend to lot of people at the same time)

Now is it ok to recommend the same restaurant to lot of people ?, streets to drivers etc.

It's not just a load-balancing problem => there should be auction.

Transparent trade-off's on fairness, privacy and social good.
