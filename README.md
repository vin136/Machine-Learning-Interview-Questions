# Basic ML Algorithms

This are the algorithms that you should aim to know inside out. (Focus on `Depth`)

1. Decision Trees and Random Forests


# SQL
General strategy: Once you are comfortable with the basics, take up SQL questions from stratscratch that have [video solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJUvdkJKEc&list=PLv6MQO1Zzdmq5w4YkdkWyW8AaWatSQ0kX), try them by yourslef and them compare. Do them both in Python and MYSQL.

To learn refer these two courses

Learsql a. Basic SQL b. Window Functions

1. Practice most commonly asked questions from [stratscratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?code_type=3)
2. [Video walk-throughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJUvdkJKEc&list=PLv6MQO1Zzdmq5w4YkdkWyW8AaWatSQ0kX)
