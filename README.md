# Basic ML Algorithms

This are the algorithms that you should aim to know inside out. (Focus on `Depth`)

0. Background (Probability,Mult-calculus,Lin-algebra)


1. Decision Trees and Random Forests

Used [Resources](https://github.com/parrt/msds621), [jeremy howard decision tree/rf](https://course18.fast.ai/ml.html), code for [fastai ml](https://github.com/Giffy/AI_fast.ai/tree/master/Machine%20Learning)


# SQL
General strategy: Once you are comfortable with the basics, take up SQL questions from stratscratch that have [video solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJUvdkJKEc&list=PLv6MQO1Zzdmq5w4YkdkWyW8AaWatSQ0kX), try them by yourslef and them compare. Do them both in **Python and MYSQL.**

To learn refer these two courses

Learsql a. Basic SQL b. Window Functions

1. Practice most commonly asked questions from [stratscratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?code_type=3)
2. [Video walk-throughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJUvdkJKEc&list=PLv6MQO1Zzdmq5w4YkdkWyW8AaWatSQ0kX)
3. [Practice SQL questions](https://www.interviewquery.com/questions?searchQuery=&searchQuestionTag=&searchCompany=&ordering=Recommended&pageSize=50&page=0&tags=Pandas&tags=SQL&tags=R&tags=Database+Design&extraFilters=Popular)
4. This [educative course might be helpful](https://www.educative.io/module/JZmo10C1K3V0gqV0w/10370001/5844917766586368)

# Statistics and Probability

Focus on improving understanding, use brilliant.org

Recommended Courses:
1. intro to prob(10),Perplexing probability(19),knowledge and uncertainty(13)
2. Into to stat(26), stat 1(35), rand var n dist(28)
Above courses together have about 130 lessons. Aiming about 5 lessons a day => 1 month. Good time.
Suggested order: Intro to prob, Intro to stat, stat 1.

Extra: lin algebra with app (41),multivariable calc(44)
