Situational Questions:
`CONFLICT`

1. Dealt with particularly difficult co-worker / situation?

ans: 
situation: While working at Niveshi, we had a custom front-end to analyze our experiments. It was built in ruby by our CEO when the company was started. But as our requirements
grew, and kept on adding asking for more features, bugs kept on increasing : from system fetching wrong results to ocassional crashing. I realized that's because placing too much proirity on `speed` over `quality` and also
having too many things on his plate.

task:  I wanted those responsiblities to be handed over to other engineer who would rewrite it in python(as he's not well-versed in ruby and we realized adding a lang dependency is unnecessary). We did'nt agree on it as i was thinking about efficiency in the long term vs short term cost of effort and maybe slowing down a little bit.

action: We decided we'll create the functionality on the side and present it to both the CEO and CTO. This time we'r proactive as we already implemented a good chunk. Also stressed on how this free up his time which is much more valuable to the company at that stage.

result: It worked. That engineer hired an intern and completed the task. Eventually he too responsibilyt of the operations part.
