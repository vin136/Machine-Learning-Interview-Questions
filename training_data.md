# Training-data generation with GAN's

Problem: CT SCANS segmentation WITH SOME Contrast and non-contrast images.

Here since the ground truth labeling remains same for both the Constrast and non-contrast images. Also found it to work well on out-of-sample : say scans from different hospital.

Used CycleGAN : conditional GAN.
